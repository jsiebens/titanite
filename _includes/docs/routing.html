		<hr/>

		<p>
		A route is defined by a method, a path and a <code>java.util.Function&lt;Request, CompletableFuture&lt;Response&gt;&gt;</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		When a request for a particular URL is received, the Titanite router will loop over all registered routes and dispatch to the first one that matches the request.
